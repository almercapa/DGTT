# Divine General Test Taker (DGTT)

An interactive study application where users battle Divine General Mahoraga through academic mastery.

## Core Mechanics
* **HP System:** Correct answers deal damage to Mahoraga, while incorrect answers result in player damage.
* **Adaptation Wheel:** Mahoraga adapts over 8 specific intervals; the player must defeat him before he becomes immune to the subject matter.
* **Adaptive Timer:** The time allowed for questions decreases as the match progresses, forcing faster recall.
* **Difficulty Locking:** Higher difficulties are locked behind "Heavenly Restrictions" or performance milestones.

## Cursed Techniques (Power-ups)
* **Domain Expansion:** Freezes the adaptation timer for a set duration.
* **Reverse Cursed Technique:** Heals a portion of the player's HP.
* **Black Flash:** Multiplies damage dealt on the next correct answer.

## Roadmap (2026)
* **Phase 1: Concept & Research (Jan):** Rule definition, UI sketching, and basic JS logic.
* **Phase 2: Web Foundations (Jan-Feb):** Functional home page, game setup page, and static HUD mockup.
* **Phase 3: Question System & AI (Mar-May):** AI document analysis and question database integration.
* **Phase 4: Game HUD & Combat (Jun-Aug):** Implementation of HP bars, timers, and adaptation mechanics.
