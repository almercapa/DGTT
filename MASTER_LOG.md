🛠 Core Features (Descriptions)

    Adaptive Timer

        Description: The game is divided into 8 intervals; after each interval, Mahoraga's wheel spins once to adapt and the question you are working on is marked incorrect, forcing you to pick a new one (goal: complete the question before the wheel spins). When all 8 spins complete, Mahoraga finishes adapting and wins. As the player, your objective is to solve questions and deal enough damage to defeat Maho before he finishes adapting (aka before the time limit runs out).

        Status: ⏳ In Progress.

    HP System

        Description: Both the player and Mahoraga have health bars. Correct answers damage Mahoraga; wrong answers damage the player. Damage scale with problem difficulty (easy → -5 HP, medium →-10 HP).

        Status: ✅ Completed.

    Game HUD

        Description: Displays HP bars, timer, power-ups, difficulty locks, and interval count.

        Status: ⏳ In Progress.

    Battle Visuals

        Description: Stylized visuals featuring a picture of Mahoraga's face moving back and forth horizontally to replace the barebones prototype.

        Status: 📅 Expected Feb 15, 2026.

    Audio Effects

        Description: Sound effects for landing hits, receiving hits, and clicking buttons.

        Status: 📅 Expected Feb 15, 2026.

    Question Bank

        Description: Stores all questions and metadata for during and after the game (difficulty, topic, source), allowing you to review solutions as well as view explanations.

        Status: 📅 Expected Feb 15, 2026.

    Multi-Screen System

        Description: A home page with buttons for different options (study sets, battle, audio/game settings, contact page).

        Status: 📅 Expected Mar 30, 2026.

    Contact Page

        Description: Credits page featuring professional links (LinkedIn) and project props.

        Status: 📅 Expected Mar 30, 2026.

    Study Set Page

        Description: Allows you to either generate questions or input your own questions. Keep these in navigable locations almost like save files in a game.

        Status: 📅 Expected May 30, 2026.

    Timer Customization

        Description: Players can choose quiz duration (e.g., 5-8 min flash study or 60-90 min exam simulation). Regardless of total time, it's always split into 8 adaptation intervals.

        Status: 📅 Expected May 30, 2026.

    Exam Mode

        Description: Instead of variable damage, each question acts like a percentage of Mahoraga's hp. Correct answers decrease the amount by how many questions (like each q for a 12 q exam would be worth 1/12 of mahoragas hp). Incorrect answers deal the same number of damage percentage to the player. Incorrect answers get sent back to the end of the quiz to be redone, the player can redo them as long as they still have both hp and time left. At the end, a "grade report" will be provided, giving you your total score if this was an actual exam.

        Status: 📅 Expected May 30, 2026.

    Hardcore Toggle

        Description: Optional "Heavenly Restriction" mode: all questions deal double damage (both to Mahoraga and the player), but the timer drains twice as fast. Designed for challenge or speed runs.

        Status: 📅 Expected May 30, 2026.

    Pre-match Pop-up

        Description: A pop up screen where you choose the study set you want to use and then additional settings for selected power up, timer customization, and hardcore toggle.

        Status: 📅 Expected Jun 30, 2026.

    User Progress

        Description: User profiles to save user data, quiz history, and performance.

        Status: 📅 Expected Oct 30, 2026.

    AI-generated Questions

        Description: AI generates questions based on uploaded study material (PDFs, notes, slides).

        Status: 📅 Expected Dec 30, 2026.

    Power up System

        Description: Players have limited-use abilities inspired by JJK to gain temporary advantages (Domain Expansion, Reversed Cursed Technique). Includes the Black Flash mechanic: answering 4–5 hard questions correctly in a row rewards the player with a "Zone" state, allowing for consecutive high-damage critical hits (2.5× multiplier) as long as the streak is maintained.

        Status: 📅 Expected Jan 2027.
